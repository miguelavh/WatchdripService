<h1>Watchdrip Service</h1>
<br>
New app that receives BG data from mobile, only compatible with ZEPPOS 3 and newer. Data is received as soon as it’s produced (without delay and less battery consumption), everything is done in the background and there is no interruption of synchronization due to pending notifications…
<br>
Instructions are as follows… you need to install the mini-app and press the button to start the service (it will ask you for permissions to run the service and check it to start it). Once started, you will receive a notification indicating that it has started.
<br>
You also need to update the watchface to any compatible…
<br>
Also added a shortcut-card and a widget that you can add to the watch to view glucose data and the service status at a glance.
<br>
Important, don’t uninstall watchdrip mini-app, If for any reason the service stops, the watchfaces will automatically operate with the previous system…
<br>
Enjoy.
